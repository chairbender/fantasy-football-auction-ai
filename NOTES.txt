PR idea notes for tensorforce:
 had to convert my input to float32 from int.
 had to write batchnorm and permute
 can't control ordering for conv2d
 hard to visualize the network architecture and understand it / inputs / outputs of each layer
 have to reshape in order to get my data to work with conv2d (adding channel)
 when there's a problem, hard to know which spot in the network spec was the issue
 why are you not using keras or tf?
